The next two lessons will primarily be dedicated to functions. In this lesson, we will introduce functions, including some basic terminology and why they are useful. We'll also take a look at some examples of how to use built-in functions. In the next lesson (Lesson 6), we will practice building our own functions and modules. <br><br>This week's tutorial (Tutorial 2) and homework (Homework 2) will be based on content reviewd in this lesson and the next one. You are strongly encouraged to review the content in these lessons *before* trying the lab/homework.
