In today's pre-recorded lectures, we are going to go over:
1. Modules: a way of organizing and reusing code, and
2. Variable scope: what parts of memory can your program access at any given time?

In live lecture, we will pick up from Wednesday and try our diamond exercise again (without rushing through it).
